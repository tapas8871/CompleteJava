## Introduction

Java is a versatile and powerful programming language used for building a wide range of applications, from mobile apps to large-scale enterprise systems. This repository provides a structured approach to learning Java, covering fundamental concepts, advanced topics, and practical examples.

## Getting Started

To get started with Java, you will need to set up your development environment and familiarize yourself with the basics of the language.

### Prerequisites

- JDK (Java Development Kit) installed on your machine. You can download it from [Oracle's official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) or use OpenJDK.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each focusing on a specific topic or aspect of Java programming:

- `basics/`: Basic concepts and syntax of Java.
- `advanced/`: Advanced topics such as concurrency, networking, and JavaFX.
- `projects/`: Sample projects and practical applications.
- `exercises/`: Coding exercises and challenges to test your knowledge.

## Installation

To clone this repository to your local machine, use the following command:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/complete-java.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```sh
cd complete-java
```

## Usage

Explore the different directories to find tutorials, sample code, and exercises. You can run the Java programs using your IDE or the command line. For example, to compile and run a Java program from the command line:

```sh
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```
